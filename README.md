# Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Description

**Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression** is a data science project designed to develop a predictive model for identifying the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on specific health indicators. This project utilizes logistic regression, a powerful statistical method well-suited for binary classification problems.

### Key Components

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gathered a comprehensive dataset containing relevant health features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), age, and other pertinent variables.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Conducted thorough data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure the dataset is suitable for training a machine learning model.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Performed EDA to gain insights into the relationships between different features and their impact on diabetes. Visualizations and statistical analyses were employed to uncover patterns and correlations.

4. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Extracted and transformed features to enhance the model's predictive capabilities. Feature scaling and normalization were applied as needed.

5. **Logistic Regression Model:**
   - Implemented a logistic regression model, a widely used algorithm for binary classification tasks. The model was trained on a subset of the dataset, validated, and fine-tuned for optimal performance.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assessed the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Utilized cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalizability.

7. **Deployment:**
   - Integrated the trained logistic regression model into a user-friendly interface, allowing users to input their health parameters and receive predictions regarding their likelihood of having diabetes.

### Goals

- Develop an accurate and reliable predictive model for early detection of diabetes.
- Provide a user-friendly tool for individuals to assess their diabetes risk based on personal health information.
- Contribute to the broader field of healthcare analytics and preventive medicine.

### Outcome

The *Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression* project aims to empower individuals with a proactive approach to managing their health by leveraging machine learning techniques. By offering a reliable prediction tool, this project seeks to facilitate early intervention and promote better health outcomes in the context of diabetes prevention.

### Setting Up project locally

- Create a folder "Diabetes-Prediction".
- Open it with vs code and run following command in the terminal.
- pip install requirement.txt
- After installing requirements run python application.py 

### Update 1.0
- Tried different models for the prediction 
- Conclusion: The Logistic Regression gave the highest accuracy of around 76% among all.
- Further scope: To use Ensemble Learning Techniques to further increase the accuracy of the model.
